Bismark - A tool to map bisulfite converted sequence reads and determine cytosine methylation states

> A functional version of Bowtie or Bowtie2 is required. For BAM output Samtools is also required

- Convert a specified reference genome into two different bisulfite converted versions and index them for alignments with Bowtie 2 (default), or Bowtie 1.
